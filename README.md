# Common Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Their Application to the N-Queens Problem

This is the code repository for my article about 4 common A.I. algorithms:

- Hill-Climbing (or steepest ascent)
- Simulated Annealing
- Local Beam Search
- Genetic Algorithm

In this series of articles, we will apply these algorithms to the N-Queens problem, to compare their performance, see how they scale but more importantly: try to **truly** understand their working.

**/!\\ ATTENTION:** at the moment, only the **part I** of the article has been published (Hill-Climbing), I am currently working on part II.

The link is coming (_real_) soon.
